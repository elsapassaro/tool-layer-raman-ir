- Check ML pointgroup (in particular WTe2)

- General TODO CHECK

- check text in tool frontend (ack, and general checks)

- add, in output, the 2x2 cell after rotation along z, and the coordinates of the atoms for each layer after rotation
  (needed to correctly interpret the R and tau of the common transformation).
  Maybe say also what is the transformation from the original cell?

- Check all examples results

- Implement automatic tests

- add check on category I, II, III; if III, write that it's not implemented yet

- clean up code, add license

- make public, deploy in production
