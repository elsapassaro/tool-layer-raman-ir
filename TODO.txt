HIGH PRIORITY/QUICK:
- [MARCO] double check all text
  - in particular: add comment on the meaning of the superscript in the force-constant matrices?
  - Explain the 'units' of the frequency as a function of the units of the force-constant parameters

- [MARCO] Check all examples results -> The strings are in the tests!


HIGH PRIORITY:
- [MARCO+GIO] General TODO CHECK: check *all* TODOs in the code

- [MARCO] check all warnings printed for some pointgroups on the logs - are they bugs? should they be errors?

- [GIO] Understand what happens for category III. Also, add example for category III (E.g. Bi2TeI, but will probably need to change the interlayer-distance to make it category III; or create one artificially, e.g. take BiTeCl and flip it).


MID PRIORITY/PRE-PUBLICATION:

- [MARCO] Add more 2D examples, possibly with different pointgroups (both as examples and as tests)



BEFORE PUBLICATION:

- [GIO] clean up code, add README.md

- [GIO] make github repo public

- [GIO] add git tag to release a version (20.11.0?)



LOW PRIORITY/NOT CRITICAL:

- [GIO] check performance of assign_representation

- [GIO] if possible, change default input parser to cif

- [GIO] use same bonds in JSMol

- [GIO] Add units dropdown for force-constants and frequency
