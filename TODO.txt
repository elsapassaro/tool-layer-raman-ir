TASKS:
- [GIO] Check all examples results

- [GIO] Understand what happens for category III. Also, add example for category III (E.g. Bi2TeI, but will probably need to change the interlayer-distance to make it category III; or create one artificially, e.g. take BiTeCl and flip it).

- [MARCO+GIO] General TODO CHECK: check *all* TODOs in the code

- [MARCO] check all warnings printed for some pointgroups on the logs - are they bugs?


BEFORE PUBLICATION:

- [GIO] add git tag to release a version (20.11.0?)
