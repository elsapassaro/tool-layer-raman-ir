HIGH PRIORITY:
- Check ML pointgroup (in particular WTe2) - is it correct?

- General TODO CHECK: check *all* TODOs in the code

- check all warnings printed for some pointgroups on the logs - are they bugs? should they be errors?

- Check all examples results


MID PRIORITY/PRE-PUBLICATION:

- add check on category I, II, III; if III, write that it's not implemented yet

- double check all text
  - in particular: add comment on the meaning of the superscript in the force-constant matrices?

- add a variable symm_threshold to be used all over the code as precision for symmetry checks (default to 5e-2)

- add checkboxes instead of a dropdown menu to select one (or more) set of modes to be visualised (e.g. the two shear but not the breathing)

- clean up code

- make github repo public

- Implement automatic tests
  - Note: they could be the current examples, but also add examples of 3D, examples of 2D but different layers, etc.

- Add more 2D examples, possibly with different pointgroups

LOW PRIORITY/NOT CRITICAL:
- check performance of assign_representation
- if possible, change default input parser to cif
