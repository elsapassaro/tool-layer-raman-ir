HIGH PRIORITY/QUICK:
- [MARCO] Check BN P-6m2 (in xsf-examples/not-layered): is it true that it does not have a common transformation?

- [MARCO] Also, check the structures for graphite and BN - they come from COD from the 2D project, but the stacking does not seem right for one of the two?

- [MARCO] double check all text; in particular: add comment on the meaning of the superscript in the force-constant matrices?


HIGH PRIORITY:
- [MARCO+GIO] General TODO CHECK: check *all* TODOs in the code

- [MARCO] check all warnings printed for some pointgroups on the logs - are they bugs? should they be errors?

- [MARCO] Check all examples results

- [GIO] Understand what happens for category III. Also, add example for category III (E.g. Bi2TeI, but will probably need to change the interlayer-distance to make it category III; or create one artificially, e.g. take BiTeCl and flip it).

MID PRIORITY/PRE-PUBLICATION:

- [GIO] Implement automatic tests (using the examples in the folder)

- [MARCO] Add more 2D examples, possibly with different pointgroups



BEFORE PUBLICATION:

- [GIO] clean up code, add README.md

- [GIO] make github repo public

- [GIO] add git tag to release a version (20.11.0?)



LOW PRIORITY/NOT CRITICAL:

- [GIO] check performance of assign_representation

- [GIO] if possible, change default input parser to cif
